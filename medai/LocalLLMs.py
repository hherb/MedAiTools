"""
Placeholder module for local LLM management utilities.

This module is intended for future implementation of:
- Local model discovery and management
- Model download and installation helpers
- Local model performance benchmarking
- GPU/CPU resource management for local inference

Currently, local LLM functionality is handled by the LLM module using
Ollama as the backend. This module may be expanded to support additional
local inference backends (llama.cpp, vLLM, etc.) in the future.
