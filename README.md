# MedAiTools
a collection of tools and python libraries for use in medical practice and research. Emphasis on using only tools and LLMs that can be run locally with limited resources, in order to protect against privacy breaches and stay independent of subscription shackles.

- MyRAGLibrarian: a vector database grounded knowledge retrieval system. Upload PDF files etc, and chat with your data in natural language.
  The purpose is to be able to have answers from an AI grounded on attributable sources, easily extensible, and easy to keep the knowledge base up to date
  
- MedRxivScraper: a system to download pre-publications from medRxiv (thanks guys, wonderful service!!!) & have the papers automatically summarised & critiqued.
  The purppose is to establish an automatised "news service" that presents the freshest pre-publications, including food for thought (the LLM generated critique of the papers)

- StudyCritique: LLM based system to analyze publications, eg finding weaknesses in argumentation or methods, abstractive rather than extractive high quality summaries of texts of arbitrary length, and re-ranking of retrieved documents in alignment with user preferences & domain (get to read the most important stuff - to you - first!)
