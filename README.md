# MedAiTools
a collection of tools and python libraries for use in medical practice and research. Emphasis on using only tools and LLMs that can be run locally with limited resources, in order to protect against privacy breaches and stay independent of subscription shackles.

- MyRAGLibrarian: a vector database grounded knowledge retrieval system. Upload PDF files etc, and chat with your data
  The purpose is to be able to have LLM answers grounded on atributable sources, easily extensible and easy to keep the knowledge base up to date
  
- MedRxivScraper: a system to download pre-publications from medRxiv (thanks guys, wonderful service!!!) & have the papers automatically summarised & critiqued.
  The purppose is to establish an automatised "news service" that presents the freshest pre-publications, incluing food for thought (the LLM generated critique of the papers)

- StudyCritique: LLM based system to analyze publications, eg finding weaknesses in argumentation or methods, abstractive rather than extractive summaries of textx of arbitray length, and re-ranking of retrieved documents in alignment with user preferences & domain
